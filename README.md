# myscrobble.fm (v2.0 - React) #
MyScrobble.FM is my GA's Front-End Web Development course final project.

### Description ###
Based on a Lasf.fm username the app creates a full detailed one page site containing things like:

* Featured last scrobbled song (with "on tour" status)
* Top listened songs (fetching all details including artwork)
